# Jetta---Autonomous-Configurable-PC-Task-Doer
Jetta uses hit boxes to find elements on screen and use them . This is an older project  made in the first months of 2023 but since I saw someone doing the same project I decided to release the code to the open-source .
The file called ' ALF 0.1 -Poate pune patratele verzi pe cuvintele recunoscute ' can find elements on the screen and put hit boxes on  what it finds . Also you can edit them and in the end it will save them in a folder .   The name of the saved image along with the saved image corresponding to the hit box will be used by 
 ' Jetta 1.71-merge sa apese pe ecran aici '  to  find that saved hit box element on screen and press it .  The script is looking  for words corresponding to the name of the saved .jpg files  and after it finds the names in the chat it searches to match the element on screen and press it .  

 The code could be further refined and enhanced to work with different computer programs and not only click but also do task that are harder .
